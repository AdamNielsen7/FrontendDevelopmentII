        <li>"JavaScript didn't have classes before ES6, and used the concept of using actual objects as the blueprint for creating more objects. This is known as aprototype-basedlanguage.</li>
        <li>"The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method. These are sometimes called class methods in other programming languages. A static method is called by the class directly rather than by instances of the class.</li>
        <li>obj.constructor.prototype to view prototype of obj</li>
        <li>"A design pattern that seeks to solve these problems is to use 'composition over inheritance'. This approach advocates creating small objects that describe single tasks or behaviors and using them as the building blocks for more complex objects.</li>
